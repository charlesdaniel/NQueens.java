## NQueens

### Introduction

The N-Queens Problem is a general case of the [Eight Queens Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle). It all boils down to the question: 

    Find a configuration of on an NxN chess board where N queen pieces can be placed and none of them can capture any other.

This Java based implementation uses the typical backtracking method to find the first solution available and prints out the board in glorious ASCII (fixed-width terminal fonts work best).

### Disclaimer
This is my old University homework from 2002 (Java has changed since then). While this code is released to the public domain, I do ask that you keep your Academic Integrity and not blindly copy this for your own homework assignment.

### TODO

* Modify it to find the total number of solutions (there is usually more than one solution)
